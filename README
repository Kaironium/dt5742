Installation
------------

These installation instructions have only been tested on Fedora 34, but they
should work on any recent Fedora, RHEL, CentOS, or Rocky Linux version.

First, you should install hdf5, numpy, psycopg2, root, and pyroot with either:

```
$ sudo dnf install hdf5 hdf5-devel python3-numpy python3-psycopg2 root python3-root
```

or

```
$ sudo yum install hdf5 hdf5-devel python3-numpy python3-psycopg2 root python3-root
```

Then, install the dependencies

```
$ sudo make install-deps
```

Finally, you can build the wavedump program:

```
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

Running
-------

You can run the wavedump software by running:

```
$ wavedump -b [barcode] -v [voltage] test.hdf5 -n 1000
```

Analyzing Results
-----------------

You can analyze the results by running:

```
$ analyze-waveforms test.hdf5 -o test.root --plot
```

Uploading Results
-----------------

First, you need to set an environment variable containing the password to the
database, and ideally add it to your .bashrc:

```
$ echo 'export BTL_DB_HOST=[HOSTNAME]' >> ~/.bashrc
$ echo 'export BTL_DB_PASS=[PASSWORD]' >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

You can analyze the results by running:

```
$ analyze-waveforms test.hdf5 -o test.root --upload
```
