BTL Testing Website
===================

This directory contains the files necessary to run a copy of the web server for
collating the BTL module testing results. Data is stored in a postgres database
that is uploaded by the analysis software in the `wavedump` directory of this
repository. The data is then shared using a website run by Flask.

Installation
------------

The server must be running CentOS-8. First, make sure all the available
software is updated:

```console
# dnf update -y
```

Next, we install and enable the postgres server software:

```console
# dnf install postgresql postgresql-server
# postgresql-setup --initdb --unit postgresql
# systemctl start postgresql
# systemctl enable postgresql
```

Next, we install the software necessary to run the webserver:

```console
# dnf install python3-flask python3-gunicorn python3-sqlalchemy python3-psycopg2 python3-pytz nginx
# systemctl start nginx
# systemctl enable nginx
```

Next, change the password in `settings.txt`:

```console
# vim settings.txt
```

Finally, run:

```console
# make install
```
