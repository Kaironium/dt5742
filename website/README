BTL Testing Website
===================

This directory contains the files necessary to run a copy of the web server for
collating the BTL module testing results. Data is stored in a postgres database
that is uploaded by the analysis software in the `wavedump` directory of this
repository. The data is then shared using a website run by Flask.

Installation
------------

The server must be running CentOS-8. First, make sure all the available
software is updated:

```console
# dnf update -y
```

Next, we install and enable the postgres server software:

```console
# dnf install postgresql postgresql-server
# postgresql-setup --initdb --unit postgresql
# systemctl start postgresql
# systemctl enable postgresql
```
